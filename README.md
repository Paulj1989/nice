# nice

This surely qualifies as the stupidest R package ever created.

Have you ever wondered whether you've made anything nice in R? No probably not. No one ever makes anything nice. We just make errors. But in the midst of all the mistakes, maybe you'd like some sweet relief. Maybe checking whether there's a 69 anywhere in your outputs?

You can't say I didn't warn you that this package is stupid!

## Installation & Usage

To install nice:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("paulj1989/nice")
```

To check if your outputs are noiiiiiiice:

```R
nice::check(69)
```

You can also check if there's anything nice in your data frame:

```R
nice::check_df(df)
```

I won't be submitting this to CRAN because there are limits to how far I'll go to make a dumb joke. Please enjoy.
